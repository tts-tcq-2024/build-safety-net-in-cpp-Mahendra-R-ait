Test Cases


Case 1: Single letter input
•	Given: A single letter. Ex: A, B, a, b etc.
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should contain the letter as it is but in the upper case and pad the last 3 places with 0’s
•	Examples:
Input					Output
 A					 A000
 B					 B000
 a					 A000
 b					 B000


Case 2: Repeated double letter input
•	Given: A two letter repeating input. Ex: AA, BB, HH, aa etc.
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should maintain the upper case of the first letter and should replace the letter with its corresponding value or drop the letter if it is a,e,I,o,u,h,w and pad with 0’s
•	Examples:
Input					Output
 	 A					 A000
 	 B					 B100
 	 c					 C200
 	 HH					 H000


Case 3: Dropped letters as input
•	Given: a word containing just dropped letters. Ex: AEIOU, HW, hwaeiou, aa etc.
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should maintain the upper case of the first letter and drop the letter if it is a,e,I,o,u,h,w and pad with 0’s
•	Examples:
Input					Output
 	 AEIOU					 A000
 	 HW					 H000
 	 whaeiou				 W000


Case 4: Single word as input
•	Given: A single word as input. Ex: Robert, Bobby, Pfister, Ashcraft etc.
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should maintain the upper case of the first letter and should replace the other letters with its corresponding value or drop the letter if it is a,e,I,o,u,h,w and pad with 0’s if the last 3 places are not filled
•	Examples:
Input					Output
 	Robert					 R163
 	Bobby					 B100
 	Pfister					 P123
 	Ashcraft				 A261


Case 5: Numerical values as input
•	Given: numerical values as input. Ex: 0, 123, 4507 etc.
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should maintain the first value as it and pad with 0’s for the last 3 places
•	Examples:
Input					Output
 	 0					 0000
 	 123					 1000
 	 4507					 4000
Case 6: words with special characters
•	Given: words with special characters as input. Ex: Ruturaj-Gaikwad, J’Bumrah, Virat Kohli, Harish@15 etc.
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should maintain the upper case of the first letter and should replace the letter with its corresponding value or drop the letter if it is a,e,I,o,u,h,w as well as the special characters also and pad with 0’s if the last 3 places were not filled.
•	Examples:
Input					Output
 	Ruturaj-Gaikwad			 R362
 	 J’Bumrah				 J156
 	 Virat kohli				 V632

Case 7: empty  input
•	Given: no input. 
•	When: The Soundex algorithm is applied to the letter
•	Then: The result should be empty
